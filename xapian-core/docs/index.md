% Documentation

A number of pieces of documentation are available.

We suggest you start by reading the <A HREF="install">Installation
Guide</A>, which covers either installing a packaged version of Xapian for your system, or downloading the source code and unpacking, configuring,
building and installing it.

For a quick introduction to our software, including a walk-through
example of an application for searching through some data, read the <A
HREF="quickstart">Quickstart</A> document. The examples in this
document are in C++, but are deliberately simple and should be
readable without prior experience of the language. In addition, the
concepts introduced are applicable to programmers using Xapian from
other languages.


The <a href="glossary">glossary</a> provides definitions for
specialized terminology you might encounter while using Xapian.
We also have a <A HREF="http://wiki.xapian.org/">wiki</A> for documentation
and examples contributed by the Xapian community.


The <A HREF="overview">Overview</A> explains the API which Xapian
provides to programmers.  A full
<A HREF="apidoc/html/index.html">API Reference</A> is automatically
collated using doxygen from documentation comments in the source code.
There's also a list of <A HREF="deprecation">deprecated features</A>
which lists features scheduled for removal, and also features already
removed, along with suggestions for replacements.


If you want to learn more about probabilistic information retrieval,
there's a (reasonably mathematical)
<A HREF="intro_ir">introduction to the ideas behind Xapian</A>
which also suggests some books you might want to read.
