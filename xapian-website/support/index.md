% Support for Xapian

## Mailing lists

The `xapian-discuss` and `xapian-devel` <a href="lists">mailing lists</a>
are the primary point of contact for the project, and are a great way
of getting support.  Please don't mail individual developers directly
unless **explicitly** requested to.  Mailing just one developer means
you've less chance of getting an answer than mailing all the
developers!

Similarly, please reply to the mailing list rather than privately.  If
you're getting free help and advice the least you can do is make sure the
whole message thread is in the list archive to help others in the future!

## IRC

The Xapian developers, and many experienced users, hang out on <a href='irc:irc.freenode.net/xapian'>#xapian on Freenode</a>, and so this is also a good place to ask questions. (Although IRC is more "real time" than the mailing lists, due to timezone differences it may still take a while for you to get a reply.)

## Bug tracking

Xapian uses Trac, an integrated wiki and bug-tracker. You have to register on <a href='http://trac.xapian.org/'>our trac installation</a> to make changes; for bug reporting specifically we have <a href='bugs'>some more information</a>.

## Commercial support

If you want private one-to-one assistance and are prepared to pay for
it, <a href="commercial">consultancy services</a> are available.
