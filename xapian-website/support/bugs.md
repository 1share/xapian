% Bug tracking and reporting in Xapian

We use trac as our bug-tracker. Bugs were migrated from the Bugzilla installation which we previously used. Note that to create a new bug report you will first need to create yourself an account on [our trac installation](http://trac.xapian.org/) and log in to it. Please choose one of the following options.

 * <a href='http://trac.xapian.org/report'>View existing bug reports</a>
 * <a href='http://trac.xapian.org/newticket'>Create a new bug report</a>
 * <a href='http://trac.xapian.org/register'>Create a new trac account</a>

When reporting bugs, please try to give us much information and detail as possible, to make your problem easier to replicate and fix.
