Geospatial support.

Warning - experimental code!
You probably don't want to use this branch!

If you're just looking for basic geospatial search support, you're probably
best off reading http://trac.xapian.org/ticket/481, and using whatever the most
stable patch attached to that is (applying the patch to trunk).  Or, if the
ticket has been closed, just use trunk (since that'll mean that the patch has
been applied).
