	* generic/generic.mk,imgseek/imgseek.i,imgseek/python/Makefile.am:
	  First version which actually compiles and links.  A bit of a mess
	  in various places, and doesn't handle exceptions correctly (lacks
	  a handler, so exceptions result in a crash).  Also needs work to
	  make it possible to use the module uninstalled.
